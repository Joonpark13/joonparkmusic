This piece was composed for the senior recital of my BM Music Composition degree.

### Program Notes:

> The boy awoke as the sun rose. There, in front of him, where the small stars had been the night before, was an endless row of date palms, stretching across the entire desert. “We’ve done it!” said the Englishman, who had also awakened early. But the boy was quiet. He was at home with the silence of the desert, and he was content just to look at the trees. He still had a long way to go to reach the Pyramids, and someday this morning would just be a memory. But this was the present moment ... and he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future. Although the vision of the date palms would someday be just a memory, right now it signified shade, water, and a refuge from the war. Yesterday, the camel’s groan signaled danger, and now a row of date palms could herald a miracle.

*from* The Alchemist *by Paulo Coelho*

While the three parts of the title respectively correspond to the three sections of the piece, I hope that the piece as a whole evokes the mood and image of a stranger and his shadow wandering the desert, in search of something elusive and far away.
