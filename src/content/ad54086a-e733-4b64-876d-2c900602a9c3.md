I was asked by my friend and conductor DaJuan Brooks to write a piece for wind ensemble, with a few exciting requirements thrown in: he wanted something that was relatively fast, had a lot of fast moving figures, and it had to be flashy with a loud ending. I've often found that composing with a few creative requirements can be the most fun (much like film scoring), and this piece was no exception. I knew from the get go that I wanted the piece to portray something with enormous energy. This, combined with the requirement for speed, conjured up the image of a particle accelerator (which uses incredible amounts of energy to accelerate and collide fundamental particles near the speed of light, to study the remnants of the collisions in order to discover new particles). As a student studying physics I was greatly inspired by the discovery of the Higgs Boson in 2012, and I decided to write a piece depicting the exciting search for this recently discovered particle and the engineering marvel that was used to discover it: the Large Hadron Collider.

I'd like to thank DaJuan Brooks, to whom which this piece is dedicated, for giving me the opportunity to write this piece and shaping it into something better than what I'd written on the page.
