### Program Note:

Chaos and Chorale depicts a struggle between the dark and the light, the disorderly and the harmonious, the cacophonous and peaceful. The two distinct sections are in many ways polar opposites: rhythmic content, harmonic content, tempo, and mood all drastically differ from one to the other. However, the first section, "Chaos," foreshadows what is to come in the "Chorale" section through frequent interruptions that eventually become quotes for the Chorale main motif. The end of the piece sees a layering of both sections in a modally ambiguous, driving push towards the climactic finish. The Chaos ostinato slowly fades away as the ensemble makes its final statement.

A huge thank you to Dr. Mallory Thompson, Dominic Talanka, and Juan Campoverde.
